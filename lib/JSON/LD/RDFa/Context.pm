=head1 NAME

JSON::LD::RDFa::Context - A JSON-LD context

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $context = JSON::LD::RDFa::Context->parse($context);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a general-purpose JSON-LD context. It resides in this
namespace for now, even though it could easily be called
C<JSON::LD::Context>. It may indeed be called that one day.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

=over 4

=item base

The base URI, if set.

=cut

has base => (
    is     => 'rw',
    isa    => MaybeURIRef,
    coerce => 1,
);

=item vocab

The default vocabulary, if set.

=cut

has vocab => (
    is     => 'rw',
    isa    => MaybeURIRef,
    coerce => 1,
);

=item language

The language, if set.

=cut

has language => (
    is     => 'rw',
    isa    => MaybeLang,
    coerce => 1,
);

=item version

The JSON-LD version, either 1.0 or 1.1.

=cut

has version => (
    is     => 'rw',
    isa    => JSONLDVersion,
    coerce => 1,
);

=item ns

This is a conventional L<URI::NamespaceMap>.

=cut

has ns => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => NamespaceMap,
    coerce  => 1,
    default => sub { URI::NamespaceMap->new },
);

=item terms

These are any terms that are not namespaces.

=cut

has terms => (
    is      => 'rwp',
    isa     => HashRef,
    default => sub { {} },
);

=item deref

A subroutine reference that takes a URI as input and returns either a
valid JSON-LD string or already-parsed object.

=cut

# a subroutine which will take a URI and produce JSON-LD
sub _no_deref {
    JSON::LD::RDFa::Error->throw(
        'This instance doesn\'t support remote contexts!');
}

has deref => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => CodeRef,
    default => sub { \&_no_deref },
);

# to prevent loops, stash remote contexts which have already been seen
has _seen => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => HashRef,
    init_arg => undef,
    default  => sub { {} },
);

=head2 process $CONTEXT [, %ETC]

Process and return a new context object. This method can be called
either as a constructor or as an instance method. When called as an
instance method, it will return a new context merged with the
existing instance. All internal members will also be cloned.

Note that C<$CONTEXT> here is assumed to be JSON which has already
been parsed: either a C<HASH> reference, a scalar representing a
remote context URI (or L<URI> object proper), or an C<ARRAY> reference
containing some quantity of the former two.

In addition to the JSON-LD content, there are three key-value
parameters:

=over 4

=item base

Supply a base URI if one isn't defined in the context's payload. This
would be, for instance, the URI from which the JSON-LD document was
retrieved. This can be a string or L<URI> object (it will be coerced).

=item deref

Supply a C<CODE> reference to retrieve remote contexts, which this
module does not do by itself. What follows is an extremely naÃ¯ve
example of the kind of code which is expected to do the job:

  sub deref {
      my $self = shift;
      my $resp = LWP::UserAgent->new->get(shift);

      if ($resp->is_success) {
          # see the relevant doc for this way of handling redirects
          $self->mark_assert($resp->request->uri) if $resp->previous;

          # return value will be parsed but you may want to check that
          # it's JSON...
          return $resp->content;
      }

      # otherwise undef
  }

The function is called as if it is an instance method of the context,
which gives it access to members like L</

=item clone

Deep-clone the object's members. Defaults to I<true>. Set it to a
false value to reuse the same ones.
